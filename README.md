**Trade-offs:**

1. **Code Readability vs Efficiency:**
   - Using `std::min_element` and `std::max_element` ensures code clarity and simplicity but may result in redundant scans over the same vectors in different functions (`get_min` and `get_max`). This could be avoided by implementing a single-pass algorithm.
   - The decision to use a separate function for `get<minmax_t::MIN>` and `get<minmax_t::MAX>` allows for modular code, improving readability.

2. **Single-pass Algorithm:** 
   - Combining the logic to compute both minimum and maximum in a single function would reduce redundant iterations but would add complexity. Instead of doing this, the current implementation performs the minimum and maximum computations separately.

#### Alternatives Considered:
1. **Single-pass Algorithm:**
   - By iterating over the vectors once and checking both minimum and maximum values simultaneously, we can optimize the number of passes. However, this approach sacrifices code readability for performance.
   
2. **Separate Minimum and Maximum Calculations (Chosen):**
   - The current approach performs separate minimum and maximum calculations but keeps the code clean and modular.

 
 
**Evaluation of Alternatives**

If time and network constraints were not a concern, the following approaches could be taken to evaluate the alternatives:

1. **Performance Profiling:**
   - Implement both the single-pass and multi-pass versions and run performance benchmarks on large datasets (millions of elements) to evaluate execution time. Tools like `gprof` or `valgrind` can be used to collect profiling data.
   
2. **Code Maintainability:**
   - Conduct code reviews to gather feedback on the maintainability of each version. While the single-pass approach could be faster, it may be harder to maintain and debug in case of bugs.
   
3. **Memory Usage:**
   - Analyze the memory usage of both approaches. Although both implementations are expected to have similar memory footprints, it's essential to ensure that no extra memory is being unnecessarily allocated.

4. **Stress Testing:**
   - Perform stress testing by running the functions with very large vectors (billions of elements) and observe their behavior to ensure no unexpected performance bottlenecks arise.

After evaluating these alternatives, a conclusive decision can be made by balancing the trade-offs between performance and readability. If the performance gains from a single-pass approach are marginal, the multi-pass approach may still be preferred for its simplicity.
